 @SECtest/frontend

 This repo I am using React + Vite 

## Setup

To run the frontend you need to install and build its dependencies. You can do it by running the following
commands in the repository root:


```
npm i -g vite
yarn
vite
```

## Scripts

- `npm i -g vite` - install the Vite tool in your local machine
- `vite` - run the development server
- `vite build` - compile the production static site
- `yarn test` - run unit test
